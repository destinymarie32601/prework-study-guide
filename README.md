# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

The motive of this project was to gain familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github. This project was built to help boot camp students have easy access to key notes to help get ready for the start of the boot camp. This project solves the need to declutter study materials and have a good platform to easily navigate important notes for class. Throughout making this project, I learned how to navigate Github, I learned how to navigate through different branches, the importants of checking the git status, and key components of Javascript.
